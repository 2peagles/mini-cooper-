 2.So today was a wild one i started getting so content on the page, after messing around with the nav I finally started to understand the grid row/col it's epic!
    it makes things so much easier and with that i understand the flexbox a bit more now
    I still need to fix my navigation bar its a mess 
    Also i need to fix the slideshow it's the words that's getting me confused i need to do a deepdive on the two of those things. I did get a good amount of work I think so tommorow Ill finish the home page and see what I can do about that navigation!

 DAY THREE
  I didn't get the navigation bar today, i continued with the home page I got the two card sections almost done, and the contact part almost done. I ran into a wee bit of a problem with my row/cols 
  I started to realized more about them when it came to getting the section background to work I wasn't using sections before but once I stared i got the background to work now i just need to fix the background on the content it's all stuck togther and i'm a bit confused. As far as rows are concerned I understand the placement with order inwhich something is shown on a small screen vs larger ones.
