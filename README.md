 2.So today was a wild one i started getting so content on the page, after messing around with the nav I finally started to understand the grid row/col it's epic!
    it makes things so much easier and with that i understand the flexbox a bit more now
    I still need to fix my navigation bar its a mess 
    Also i need to fix the slideshow it's the words that's getting me confused i need to do a deepdive on the two of those things. I did get a good amount of work I think so tommorow Ill finish the home page and see what I can do about that navigation!

 DAY THREE
  I didn't get the navigation bar today, i continued with the home page I got the two card sections almost done, and the contact part almost done. I ran into a wee bit of a problem with my row/cols 
  I started to realized more about them when it came to getting the section background to work I wasn't using sections before but once I stared i got the background to work now i just need to fix the background on the content it's all stuck togther and i'm a bit confused. As far as rows are concerned I understand the placement with order inwhich something is shown on a small screen vs larger ones.

I went back and fixed my form still looks a bit out of wack I added my footer and the legal, the footer got a bit messed up for some reason the list is over going on the same line.
DAY FOUR ( mobile day)
 1. Something was wrong with my buttons I had no clue what it was so I decided to comb through all the code and figured it out, my code looked correct but when I pulled up the console it said my btn had 40px top & bottom which was no where in my code. So I moved and came back to later I ended up just setting button with all the css and taking btn class off of my buttons whihc fixed the problem but then my bootstrap buttons went out of wack they have a hover affect which is not needed a problem i will come back to. Looking for problems I found I had grabbed the ul, li, a for my footer but that grabbed all of my ul,li, & a so now they all have the css which I have to figure otu how to fix later. I got the background correct for my featured section. I also got my footer to have a menu on mobile which is nice. I got my form to look correct mobile to taking up 12 and then 6 on mobile.

I fixed the contact icons, that was simple just adding a classname and reapplying the li,ul,a css
I fixed the boxes on the card/feature section, adding an extra col and then fixing the padding/margin as well as adding @media max-width 500px to ajust teh padding/margin and added bootstrap responsive xs md.
I played with the biglove section a big as well just to clean up the code,
I looked at the slideshow and tried to figure out the nav which is tommorows problem. I have no clue why the nav as dropdown is gone. I think it might be bc of the @media I did for my footer.

Day FIVE
    Starting off with the navigation just a matter of adding a class to my footer, dropdown and now my navigation dropdown is visable again. So the problem now is the footer button color/ width is now not working. ok I got everything to work correctly,the only thing is pushing the icon to the right and making sure the dropdown goes down and not up looks wise it's pretty darn close the code could be cleaner but I can fix that at the veery end;) time to fix the navigation.

    I got the dropdown button to go away got the correct font and size fixed the margin on the first dropdown menu. I need to add the space, and get the button to hide.
