 3.So today was a wild one i started getting so content on the page, after messing around with the nav I finally started to understand the grid row/col it's epic!
    it makes things so much easier and with that i understand the flexbox a bit more now
    I still need to fix my navigation bar its a mess 
    Also i need to fix the slideshow it's the words that's getting me confused i need to do a deepdive on the two of those things. I did get a good amount of work I think so tommorow Ill finish the home page and see what I can do about that navigation!
